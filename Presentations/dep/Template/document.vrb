\frametitle{Advanced: Altering the background pattern}
The background pattern is created using the \texttt{tikz} package. You can modify the background pattern by changing the \texttt{beamerinnerthemewildcat.sty} file. The background pattern is created in the \texttt{\textbackslash bgpattern} command defined at the top of the file.
^^I^^I\\ ~ \\
^^I^^IYou don't necessarily need to change the file itself. You can just re-define those commands in your preamble. For example, if you wanted to change the background pattern to be just the main color, you could use the following code in your preamble: \\
^^I^^I
^^I^^I\scriptsize
^^I^^I\begin{verbatim}
^^I^^I^^I\renewcommand{\bgpattern}{
^^I^^I^^I^^I\draw[color=wcprimary,fill=wcprimary] (0,0) rectangle (\paperwidth,\paperheight);
^^I^^I^^I}
^^I^^I\end{verbatim}
